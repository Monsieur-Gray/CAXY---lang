- <h3> VARIABLES
- - <h4> _VARS: Section
  - Variables are declared in the `_VARS::` Section
  - **The number of variables must be specified!**
  - In the end of the `_VARS:` Section, add `EOS!` (end of section) otherwise it'll throw an error!!
- - Variables are *immutable* by default
  - To declare *mutable* variables, add a '?' at the start of the variable name!
