<h2> Sections </h2>

- `_VARS: <?>.... EOS!` section:-
  - All variables must be declared here.
  - **?** :- The number of variables declared should be stated.
  - All variables must have a value while declaration.
  - The section must end with `EOS!`
 
    
- `_MAIN: ...... _END:` section:-
  - This is the main block like other languages.
  - All the code execution occurs here.
  - Each statement generally follows the following order :--> ``COMMAND <Variable/Const>+...``.
  - The main section must end with `_END:`.


<h2> Variables </h2>

- The following is the structure for declaring variables :--> ` <MemType> <Name> <Value>`
    - MemType --> `int`  , `float` , `str` or `bool`

- To declare Strings , use ' ' (single-inverted commas)
- **Variables are immutable by default!**
- To make a mutable variable , just add a '?' at the start of its name! :)
- Boolean variables can be `true` or `false`


<h2> ARITHMETICS </h2>

- **Syntax** --> `OPERATION NUM1 NUM2 .....` (any arbitrary number of operands)
- The following operations are currently supported --> `ADD , SUB , MULL , DIV`
- If the expression is standalone , the expression is evaluated and directly printed.
- If not , the expression **Returns the value** which can be used by other functions.

<h2> STANDARD LIBRARY </h2>

- `PRNT` - used to print a value
  - usage --> `PRNT <?>`    **?** -> *Value, Variable, Expression, another function's return value etc.* 
- More functions will be added soon!!.


<h2> EXPRESSIONS </h2>

- `Math_expression`:- syntax -> `OPERATION NUM1 NUM2 .....` (*each arithmetic statement is a math_expression*).
  
- `Conditional_expression`:-
  - `[ X <conditional_operator> Y ]` --> Conditional operators are *> , < , ==*  (<= & => are not supported)
  -  A conditional_expression can be used in **Loops** or can be PRINTED :).
  -  To declare a conditional expression , enclose it in `[..]`.
  -  EG :- `PRNT [2 > 4]` -> `false`.
    
- `Standard_expression` :- All other expressions are generally classified as *Standard_expressions* like *PRNT* statements.
- `MEMORY-inst_expr` :- Refer [Variable Mutation](#-variable-mutation-)
- *Example:-* ```
      _VARS: 2
        int a 10
        int
```

  
- Other expressions should not be worried about as they are for parsing purposes only.

*******************************

<h2> VARIABLE MUTATION </h2>

  - `MOV X Y` --> X is the variable you wanna mutate (must be mutable).
  - *Y* can be specified value, Standard_expression, Math_expression or another Variable

<h2> LOOPS </h2>

Traditional loops are for f@ggs, here we are talking serious shit!
In Caxy, we use the `JUMPIF` expression (thou shant be scared)
- Syntax :- `JUMPIF Â±n <conditional expression / X> `
- Here , **+/- n** is the number of lines ahead(+) or behind (-) you want to go :)
- The 2nd argument can be a simple *conditional_expression* or a *boolean variable*
